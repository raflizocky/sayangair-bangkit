Water scarcity is one of the environmental issues faced by Indonesia. According to a report by Bappenas, the proportion of areas with water scarcity for 
some regions in Indonesia is expected to increase from 6% in 2000 to 9.6% by 2045. One of the solutions to overcome water scarcity is to save water.
Sayang Air is a mobile application that aims to form a habit of saving water. This application displays information about the user's monthly PDAM/PAM water usage. 
Users will get points if they succeed in reducing their water usage or keep it steady compared with the previous month. These points can be exchanged for rewards. 
Sayang Air also provides a donation feature to support water conservation projects in Indonesia, such as water purification technology, wetland restoration, 
rainwater harvesting system, and more.
